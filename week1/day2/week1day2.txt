:METHOD SIGNTURE SYNTAX



OPERATORS:

1.Arithmetic operators
+,-,*,/,%

4+6=10
9-8=1
4*5=20
6/2=3
6%2=0

2.Relational operators- true/false
<,>,<=,>=,!=,==

5<6

8>5

5<=6

6>=5

5!=6

5==5

3.Logical operators
&&(AND), ||(OR)

&&-- both condition must be true

|| --either one is true 

4.Assignment operators
=

CONTROL STATEMENTS:

*Loop
*Conditional statement

Loop:

repeat the same logic  to run multiples

doing same thing again and again

two types:
for loop----whenever you know how many times you need to loop it.
10 times

while loop---when you do not know how many times we need to loop it, as it based on condition.


Conditional statement:
if-else

if---when condition is true it will print output

else-- when condition get false it  will print out

nested if ---inside the if



METHOD SIGNTURE SYNTAX:
public void name(){
}

1.Access modifier---  specifies who can access
2. return type--output of method  0 or 1
3.name-- name of method
4. input_argument(s): what are the input(s)0,1,2,...

1.ACCESS MODIFIER---  specifies who can access

ex: train
we have four types:
1. public -- Anyone can access---
2.private -- within class only we can are run it--Ac/firstclass
3.protected --within known circle
4.default -- people living in the same area


2. RETURN TYPE--output of method

can be  any data types-->  primitive  or non-primitive(java/own class)

void -- it will not return any value--syso-----null
return -- it will return the value

3.NAME-- name of method


4. INPUT_ARGUMENT(S): what are the input(s)/0,1,2.......n
