
Todays Agenda:
==============
   1)9.30-9.45-> Recap
   2)9:45-10:30->DataProvider
   3)10:30-11:10->TestNG Assertion
   4)11:10-11:40->Classroom + break
   5)11:40-12:30->Explicit Wait




Steps to implement DataProvider

1) Identify the data that are need to be dynamic for the particular testcase
    - Create Lead : 
    - Edit Lead: 
2) Create a method to pass data with @DataProvider annotation
3) Create Input array with number of columns (number of data / fields) and number of rows
    - Make sure the index starts at 0
4) Return data back to the calling class (return)
5) Receive this data in the testcase
    - use dataprovider attribute
    - Use that arguments inside the method
6) Finally, replace the hard coded value.



TestNG Assertion:

** verification and Validation

Assertion in TestNG are way to verify that the expected result and the actual result for matched or not.


two types of assert
1.Hard Assert
2.Soft Assert


what is diff b/w assert and verify?

Hard Assert:
when any assert statement fails ,it will throw the exception and stop execution.

Soft Assert:
when any assert got fails means,it will not stop execution.its continue run .
after completed it will throw the exception.










Selenium Waits:
===============

Implicit wait-->global

Explicit Wait-->Conditional wait

Elementclickinterception
StaleElement
NoSuchElement

WebDriverWait
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(15));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.conditionstobeapplied)
