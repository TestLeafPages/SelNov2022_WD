POM:
===============

what is POM?
pom.xml--->project object model


POM--> Page Object Model  

POM is framework or not?
its not framework
POM is design pattern

       pom.xml->project object model
	  

	  POM->Page Object Model
	   
	 -Page Object Model is a design pattern to build your framework
Framework:
==========
  It is a collection of multiple testcases 

Advantages:
===========
    -easy maintenance
	-Increased Productivity
	-Maintain the uniformity
	-Reduce the duplicate code
	-Better HTMl report


Steps to Implement PageObjectModel:
==================================
   1)Create a separate Project for POM
   2)Add all the dependencies in the pom.xml
   3)Create 3 packages (base,pages,runner)
   4)Inside base package create a BaseClass
   5)Inside the BaseClass have preCondition and PostCOndition(Load the url)
   6)Inside the pages package create 6 pages
       -LoginPage
	   -WelcomePage
	   -MyHomePage
	   -MyLeadsPage
	   -CreateLeadPage
	   -ViewLeadPage
   7)Make sure all the pages should extend your BaseClass
   8)For each Pages create separate methods and put the codes for each of your action
   9)Finally add the return statement
        -If the control stays  in the same page return this and change the return type
        -If the control moves to another page then add return statement according to it
		
		
		Chromedriver 1--jsie8e9cn@fxmmkzk
		chromedriver 2-- uohkdfji78u39jdAQ@
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
Reason:
-Because of static driver
  The browser which is last opened at last(latest session-id)
Steps to implement parallel execution:
======================================
   1)Remove static in the baseclass
   2)Create a Constructor in all the pages with Chromedriver as argument
   3)And pass the driver in all the constructor call
