Cucumber - BDD automation tool












TDD - Test Driven Development
------------------------------
- Write the testcases first
- Get the approval for the testcases
- Development should be based on the testcases

Cons:
- Lot of negative testcases covered rather than positive testcases

ATTD - Acceptance Test Driven Development:
------------------------------------------
- Write the acceptance testcases first
- Develop the software based on the acceptance testcases

Cons:
 - Communication gap between the Technical and non technical team
 
 
BDD - Behaviour Driven Development:
-----------------------------------
- To address the communication gap between tech and non tech team

- Write acceptance testcases first using common language
	- common language: understandable by both and tech and non tech team

Cucumber - Ruby
Cucumber - Java (Gherkins)
SpecFlow - C#   (Gherkins)


Gherkin Keywords:	
------------------
Feature     	Describes the functionality of an application (only once in the feature file)
Scenario        Describe a behaviour / testcase (it can be multiple for a feature file)
Given           Represent a pre condition
When            Represent Test Condition / Step
Then            Represent expected result (for positive scenario)
But             Represent expected result (for negative scenario)
Background      Describe a pre-condition for multiple scenarios (only once in the feature file)
And             Represent to combine the above keyword based step









3 Layers:
----------
Features            File to write the BDD Testcases (flat file)
Step Definition     Implement the test step using Java/Selenium
Runner              TestNG for execution

How to pass data from steps / parameterization:
-----------------------------------------------
- enclose the data within '' in the steps
- replace the data with {string} in the StepDefinition
- Create arguments in the method to get the input
- Replace the hard coded data with variable

How to pass multiple data set to a Scenario:
---------------------------------------------
- Use Gherkin keyword "Scenario Outline"
- Examples should follow Scenario Outline
- First row after Examples is the column hearder
- All the informations should be enclosed within ||
- Second row onwards mention data within ||
- Replace the data with <column name> in the steps
