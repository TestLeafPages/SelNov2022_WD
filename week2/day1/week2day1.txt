Xpath:


Xml path used to navigation through the html structure of the page.

when to use xpath?
incase we cannot able find  from basic locators.we can use xpath

we have 2 types
*Absolute xpath
*Relative xpath

Absolute xpath---direction of the element from the origin to destination.

its will start with '/'

Its the direct way to find the element,but the disadvantage 
of the absolute xpath is that if there are any changes made 
in the path of the element then that xpath gets failed.

/html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/form/p/input



Relative xpath--- direction from a unique element
it will start with '//'
Relative xpath starts from the middle of HTML DOM structure.
it starts with double forward slash.

syntax:

//tagname[@attribute='attributeValue']

//input[@id='username']


*Axes     xpath or Advance xpath
Axes xpath---direcion based on relationship


Basic xPaths:
1. Attribute based xPath:    - 
//tagName[@attributeName='attributeValue']
    Ex://input[@id='username']


2. Partial Attribute based xPath:    - 
//tagName[contains(@attributeName,'attributeValue')]
    

3.  Text based xPath:    - //tagName[text()='textValue']
    Ex: //label[text()='Username']

4. Partial Text based xPath:    - //tagName[contains(text(),'textValue')]
    Ex: //label[contains(text(),'name')]

5. Index/ Collection based xPath:
    - (//xpath)[index]    - (//input[@class='inputLogin'])[2]

index will start with -- 1
    - do not  prefer when index goes beyond 5
