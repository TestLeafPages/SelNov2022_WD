Abstraction:
Abstraction means hiding the complexity and only showing the essential
feature of the object.

Hiding implementation details and showing functionality to the user.

eg:mobile,ATM

1.Interface-----100% unimplementation

2.Abstract class----both implementation & unimplementation

3.Concrete class----full implementation


keywords:

class to class ---- 
class to interface ---- 
abstract class to class ---- 
interface  to interface ---- 

how we can acheive the abstraction:
we have two ways
1. interface---- desgin document

like buleprint or desgin paper
its 100% unimplementation
its should not body(code) only we can have only method.

keyword-- implements

2. abstract class---
its partial Implementation
we have both implementation and unimplementation method.

A class that is declared with an abstract keyword is known as an abstract class. 
An abstract class can have abstract methods (methods without the body) 
and concrete/non-abstract methods (Methods with the body) also.
