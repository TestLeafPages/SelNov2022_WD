Collection:

collection -- its a interface


-Dynami Array(size can grow or shrink)
-Automated increment / decrement
-collection can only hold claseses(no primitive data types)

two types

*list

*set
---------------------------------------------------------------------
List--list is a child interface of collection.
it is an ordered collection of object in which duplicate values can be stored.
list maintain the insertion order.

Arraylist: its based on index values

Linkedlist: its based on node values

properties:
* list allow duplicates
* list maintains the insertion order

ArrayList:  An ArrayList class is a resizable array, which is present in the 
java. util package. While built-in arrays have a fixed size, 
ArrayLists can change their size dynamically. Elements can be added and 
removed from an ArrayList whenever there is a need.


syntax:

List<wapper class> objectname= new ArrayList<wapper class>();

<>------ generic to restric the datatype

what is wapper class?

Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field,
we can store primitive data types. In other words, we can wrap a primitive value 
into a wrapper class object.
